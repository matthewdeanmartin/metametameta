## Bug

- if description is README.md it is very long and noisy

## UI

- make quiet option
- --verbose option
- add logging - DONE

## Sources

- Generate metadata for more source documents
  - setup.cfg - DONE
  - setup.py - DONE
  - PEP pyproject toml meta - DONE
- Restrict how much

## Finding meta data

- Simple Package (assuming well behave)
- Simple File
- Not well behaved- has meta data all over, with dupes and inconsistencies.
